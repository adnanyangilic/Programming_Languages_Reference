Commenting code helps programmers write free text that is commonly used to explain the code written, or can even be used to add TO-DOs to the code.

## Single-line Comments

Single-line comments start with a `#`.

```rb
# I am a single line comment.
```

## Multi-line comments

Multi-line comments start with `=begin` and end with `=end`.

```rb
=begin
I am a multi line comment.
I can take as many lines as needed.
=end
```
