A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure. They are used to link to external files, like:

- Websites
- Images
- Videos
- MP3 files
- Style sheets
- JavaScript code

## Absolute File Paths

URL paths in HTML can be absolute paths, like a full URL, for example:

**<span>https\:<span>\/\/codecademy\.com/resources/docs**

```html
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs">
  The URL for this anchor element is an absolute file path.
</a>
```

## Relative File Paths

Relative file path are paths that links to a local file in the same folder or on the same server, for example:

- **./about.html**
- **./style.css**
- **./images/logo.png**

Relative file paths begin with `./` followed by a path to the local file. `./` tells the browser to look for the file path from the current folder.

```html
<a href="./about.html">
  The URL for this anchor element is a relative file path.
</a>
```

## Link to a Specific Part of the Page

The anchor element `<a>` can create hyperlinks to different parts of the same HTML document using the `href` attribute to point to the desired location with `#` followed by the `id` of the element to link to.

```html
<div>
  <p id="id-of-element-to-link-to">A different part of the page!</p>
</div>

<!-- Later in the page --->

<a href="#id-of-element-to-link-to">Take me to a different part of the page</a>
```
