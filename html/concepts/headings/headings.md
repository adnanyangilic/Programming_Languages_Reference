## Accessibility with Headings

Each heading has semantic meaning for the overall structure of a page. Headings have affects on how well a page performs with SEO and how devices like screen readers can access them. Here are a few best practices for using heading elements in an accessible and SEO-friendly way:

- Keep it to one `<h1>` element to one page. This element should be associated with the main topic of the page.
- Do not skip levels. Go from `<h1>` to `<h2>` and so on.
- Avoid nesting headings too deeply so they aren't skipped.
