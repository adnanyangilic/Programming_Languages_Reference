Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the code we write.

Before Semantic HTML the elements didn’t have any meaning as to what it does or what content goes in it. An element such as `<div>` was used as a general-purpose element to create things from headers to footers to articles.

```html
<!-- Non Semantic HTML -->
<div id="footer">
  <p>This is a footer</p>
</div>
```

With Semantic HTML, we were introduced to elements that tell developers and browsers exactly what it does and what content should go in it.

```html
<!-- Semantic HTML -->
<footer>
  <p>This is a footer</p>
</footer>
```

## Why Use Semantic HTML?

- Accessibility: Semantic HTML makes webpages accessible for mobile devices and for people with disabilities as well. This is because screen readers and browsers are able to interpret the code better.

- Readability: Semantic HTML also makes the website’s source code easier to read for other web developers.

- SEO: It improves the website SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of increasing the number of people that visit your webpage. With better SEO, search engines are better able to identify the content of your website and weight the most important content appropriately.
