The `<section>` semantic HTML element defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme.

For example, content with the same theme such as articles about cricket can go under a single `<section>`. A websiteâ€™s home page could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.

## Syntax

```html
<section>
  <!-- Elements in a document with the same theme -->
</section>
```

In the following code, we created a `<section>` element to encapsulate the code. In `<section>`, we added a `<h2>` element as a heading and an `<article>` as well.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Fun Facts About Cricket</h2>
  <article>
    <p>A single match of cricket can last up to 5 days.</p>
  </article>
</section>
```

## Example

Suppose the current page wants to add two sections:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head> </head>
  <body>
    <!-- One section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Fun Facts About Cricket</h2>
      <article>
        <p>A single match of cricket can last up to 5 days.</p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <!-- Another section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Fun Facts About Cicada</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Some cicadas could explode with fungus.</p>
      </article>
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
```
