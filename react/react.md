[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or webpage components. It was released in 2013 and is currently maintained by Facebook along with a community of developers and companies.

It is component-based. An example of a component could be a form or even just a form field or button on a website. In React, applications are completely built with components.

Some of the most persistent issues of [front-end development](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/front-end) are solved with React, allowing one to build dynamic and interactive web apps with ease. It is fast, scalable, flexible, powerful, and has a robust developer community thatâ€™s rapidly growing.
