In React, components make up the UI of the application. Components are pieces of code that are reusable and independent. Each component comes with one or both of the following:

- A [state object](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/state) that contains component data that is expected to change over time.
- A [props object](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/props) with data that can be passed down from parent component to child component.

## Class Components

Class components contain a state and use a `render()` function to return [JSX](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/jsx) markup. When defined, the `class` has to be an extention of the `React.Component` class:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  this.state = {
    property1: "A string",
    property2: 1,
    property3: true
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        ...
      <div>
    )
  };
};
```

## Function Components

Function components are stateless and only use the `return` statement. No import statement necessary:

```jsx
function FunctionComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      ...
    <div>
  )
}
```

## Arrow Function

The [arrow function](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrow-functions) is a feature that was introduced in ES6. It uses the `=` and `>` characters to define a function like a variable. In React, function components can be defined with this syntax:

```jsx
const FunctionComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      ...
    <div>
  )
}
```
