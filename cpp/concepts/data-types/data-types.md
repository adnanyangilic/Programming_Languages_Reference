C++ provides a rather large number of types. However, you can write perfectly good programs using only five of those:

## Int

`int` is a type for storing integer (whole) numbers. An integer typically requires 4 bytes of memory space and ranges from -2³¹ to 2³¹.

```cpp
int year = 1991;
int age = 28;
```

## Double

`double` is a type for storing floating point (decimal) numbers. Double variables typically require 8 bytes of memory space.

```cpp
double price = 8.99;
double pi = 3.14159;
```

## Bool

`bool` is a type for storing true or false boolean values. Booleans typically require 1 byte of memory space.

```cpp
bool organ_donor = true;
bool late_to_work = false;
```

## Char

`char` is a type for storing individual characters. Characters are wrapped in single quotes '. Characters typically require 1 byte of memory space and range from -128 to 127.

```cpp
char grade = 'A';
char punctuation = '?';
```

## String

`std::string` is a type for storing text strings. Strings are wrapped in double quotes `"`.

```cpp
std::string message = "good nite";
std::string user = "@sonnynomnom";
```

## Datatype Modifiers

As the name implies, datatype modifiers are used with built-in data types to modify the length of data that a particular data type can hold. Data type modifiers in C++ are:

- `signed`
- `unsigned`
- `short`
- `long`

## Const

`const` (constant) variables cannot be changed by your program during execution.

```cpp
const double quarter = 0.25;

// and now variable quarter can only be 0.25
```

Simply add the keyword `const` before the data type during declaration to make the variable not modifiable.

## Type Conversion

A type cast is basically a conversion from one type to another.

The notation `(type) value` means “convert value to type“. So for example:

```cpp
double weight1;
int weight2;

weight1 = 154.49;
weight2 = (int) weight1;

// weight2 is now 154
```

**Note:** Going from a double to an int simply removes the decimal. There’s no rounding involved.

## Memory Size

As noted above, the data type of a variable also specifies the size of the information that it can hold:

| Data Type     | Memory Size |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `bool`        | 1 byte      |
| `char`        | 1 byte      |
| `int`         | 4 bytes     |
| `float`       | 4 bytes     |
| `double`      | 8 bytes     |
| `std::string` | 24 bytes    |
