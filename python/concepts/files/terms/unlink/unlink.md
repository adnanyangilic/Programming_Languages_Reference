The Python `.unlink()` file method allows the user to delete a file path if it exists in the system or computer. [`.remove()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/file-methods/remove) is the alternative to delete a specific file.

**Note**: A `FileNotFoundError` is raised if the file is not found or isn't in the current directory.

## Syntax

This method is provided by the `os` module which must be imported beforehand.

```pseudo
import os

os.unlink("file_path")
```

Entire folders or directories can be removed using the [`.rmdir()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/file-methods/rmdir) method.

## Example

Use `.unlink()` to delete the **my_file.txt** file:

```py
import os

# Delete file path
os.unlink("path/to/my_file.txt")
```
