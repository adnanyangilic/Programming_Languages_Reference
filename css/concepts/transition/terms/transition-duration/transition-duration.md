Specifies how long an elements transition should take to complete.

## Syntax

```css
transition-duration: <value>;
```

The `transition-duration` value can be specified by one of the folllowing:

- Seconds: `2s`
- Milliseconds: `125ms`

**Note**: We can give a comma-separated list of values to set different durations for properties of the same element. The duration of all properties will be the same if a single value is provided.

## Example 1

Setting a `h1` element to complete its transition over a duration of `3` seconds.

```css
h1 {
  transition-duration: 3s;
}
```

## Example 2

Setting a `div` elements height transition to last `4` seconds and color transiton to last `200` milliseconds.

```css
div {
  transition-duration: 4s, 200ms;
  transition-property: height, color;
}
```
