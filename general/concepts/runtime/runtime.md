Title: 'Runtime'
Description: 'In computer programming, runtime references the period of time during which a program is running, as well as the environment that communicates between the hardware and operating system. The runtime environment is specifically any software or instructions that are executed while a program is running. These instructions can include functions for optimization, memory management, debugging, and input/output. A runtime error is effectively any error a program has after it has been executed. Developers can use runtime environments to test code for debugging runtime errors, before launching the program into production.'

In computer programming, _runtime_ references the period of time during which a program is running, as well as the environment that communicates between the hardware and operating system.

The runtime environment is specifically any software or instructions that are executed while a program is running. These instructions can include functions for optimization, memory management, debugging, and input/output.

A runtime error is effectively any error a program has after it has been executed. Developers can use runtime environments to test code for debugging runtime errors, before launching the program into production.
