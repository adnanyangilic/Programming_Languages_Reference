Cloud computing is the distribution of technology services over the internet, particularly data storage (cloud storage) and computational power without direct active management by the user. Users have to pay only for the services they use. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, users can access technology services such as computing power, storage, and databases on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider. There are many cloud providers in the market providing different services with different pricing models.

## History of Cloud Computing

In 1963, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded MIT a $2 million grant for Project MAC. The funding required MIT to develop technology that would allow a computer to be used by two or more people at the same time. In this case, one of those massive, archaic computers that used reels of magnetic tape for memory and were the precursor to what is now collectively known as the cloud computing.

## How does Cloud Computing work?

It is divided into two sections, i.e., frontend and backend. They are connected through the Internet. The frontend consists of the client’s computer or computer network. Also, the application is essential to access the cloud system. Not all cloud computing systems need to have the same user interface. On the backend, the cloud is made of the following:

- Computers
- Servers
- Data Storage Systems

A cloud computing system could include any computer program, from data processing to video games. Generally, each application will have its dedicated server.

## Types of Cloud

### Public cloud

Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers that deliver their computing resources like servers and storage over the Internet. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.

### Private cloud

Private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site data center. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud.

### Hybrid cloud

Hybrid clouds are a combination of both private and public clouds. Data and applications are allowed to be shared between the private and public clouds. Allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds provides businesses greater flexibility, more deployment options, and helps optimize existing infrastructure, security and compliance.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

### 1. Cost

Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of purchasing hardware and software, establishing and operating on-site datacenters, around-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and IT experts that manage infrastructure. Users, on the other hand, only need to pay for the resources or services they use.

### 2. Speed

Most cloud providers provide on-demand services, so even large amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.

### 3. Security

Data security is a concern for every business, regardless of size and industry. Cloud Computing offers many advanced security features which guarantee that data is securely stored and handled. Cloud providers implement baseline protections for their platforms and the data they process such as authentication, access control, and encryption.

### 4. Reliability

Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity simple and affordable because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.

### 5. Scalability

Users do not have to over-provision resources for future peak levels of business activity with cloud computing. Instead, users are only provided the resources that they require. Users can instantly grow and shrink capacity by scaling these resources up or down as your business needs change.

## Who is using Cloud Computing?

A wide spectrum of enterprises have move to the cloud. Some big names include Netflix, Instagram, Apple, and more. The Codecademy team uses plenty of cloud computing serverces as well, such as AWS, Google Drive, and Notion.
