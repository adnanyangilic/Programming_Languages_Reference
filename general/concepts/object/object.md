An object is an instance of a class. It contains the properties and functionalities of its class.

When an object is created, memory will be allocated for it.

## Object Example in Java

In Java, an object is created using the `new` keyword. The `new` keyword tells the compiler to create a new instance of a class and allocate memory for it.

```java
// Creating the Employee class
class Employee {
  int id;
  String firstName;
  String lastName;
  char middleInitial;
  float years;
}

// Creating five different objects from the Employee class
Employee tina = new Employee();
Employee louise = new Employee();
Employee linda = new Employee();
Employee bob = new Employee();
Employee gene = new Employee();
```

In the above example, five different objects were created from the class `Employee`.
