Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems and networks from bad actors who disrupt services or steal sensitive information. The responsibilities of professionals in this field may include:

- Educating a company's stakeholders on the importance of cyber and information security.
- Planning in disaster recovery and responses to cybersecurity breaches.
- Closing gaps in network security and mitigating vulnerabilities.
- Defending against various [cyberattacks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/cyberattacks).

As a concept, cybersecurity covers everything from network and application security to operational security and business continuity.

## Programming Languages

Cybersecurity work involves the following programming languages:

- [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python) features tools for common tasks such as malware analysis.
- [C](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c) and [C++] are low-level and can directly access RAM and system proceses.
- [SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql) and its features in database security.
- [PHP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/php) protects against DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks.
