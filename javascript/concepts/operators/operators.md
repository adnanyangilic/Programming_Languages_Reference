An operator is a special character or series of characters that perform a task in JavaScript.

## Assignment Operator

The assignment operator (`=`) assigns a value to a variable.

```js
var x = 10;
```

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction
- `*` multiplication
- `/` division
- `%` modulo

```js
// Addition
5 + 5;
// Subtraction
10 - 5;
// Multiplication
5 * 10;
// Division
10 / 5;
// Modulo
10 % 5;
```

## Assignment Operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. Here are some of them:

- `+=` addition assignment
- `-=` subtraction assignment
- `*=` multiplication assignment
- `/=` division assignment

```js
let number = 100;

// Both statements will add 10
number = number + 10;
number += 10;

console.log(number);
// Output: 120
```

## Comparison Operators

- `==` equal to
- `===` equal value and equal type
- `!=` not equal
- `!==` not equal value or not equal type
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `?` ternary operator
