Called from an instance of the `Date` class, will return the hour according to the local time.

## Syntax

```js
myDate.getHours();
```

The return value of `getHours()` will only be an integer number between `0` and `23`, meaning the hour according to the local time.

## Example

To determine if it is 10 in the morning or not:

```js
const today = new Date('June 25, 2021 13:41:30');

if (today.getHours() === 10) {
  console.log('It is 10 in the morning now.');
} else {
  console.log('It is not 10 in the morning now.');
}

// Output: It is not 10 in the morning now.
```
