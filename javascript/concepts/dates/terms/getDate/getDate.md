Called from an instance of the `Date` class, will return the date of the month. All return values will be integers between `1` and `31`.

## Syntax

```js
myDate.getDate();
```

## Example

Suppose there is a need to find out if it is before the 10th of the current month:

```js
const today = new Date('June 22, 2021 10:41:30');

if (today.getDate() < 10) {
  console.log('It is before the 10th!');
} else {
  console.log('It is the 10th, or later!');
}

// Output: It is the 10th, or later!
```
