Called from an instance of the `Date` class, will return the month of the year.

## Syntax

```js
myDate.getMonth();
```

The return value of `getMonth()` will only be an integer number between `0` and `11`, meaning the month of the year:

- `0` represents January
- `1` represents February
- `2` represents March
- ...
- `10` represents November
- `11` represents December

## Example

To determine if it is June or not:

```js
const today = new Date('June 25, 2021 13:41:30');

if (today.getMonth() === 5) {
  console.log('Time flies, it is now June.');
} else {
  console.log('It is not 10 in the morning now.');
}

// Output: Time flies, it is now June.
```
