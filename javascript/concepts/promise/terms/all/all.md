The `.all()` method returns a new Promise that can be accessed as an array of resolved values of fulfulled Promises. It takes an iterable object, such as an `Array`, that contains one or more Promise objects. This is ideal when working with Promises that depend on one another's completion.

## Syntax

```js
Promise.all(iterableObject);
```

The `iterableObject` is usually an array of Promise objects. If the array is empty, a Promise object that resolves into an empty array will be returned.

## Example

Working with two Promise objects, `promiseA` and `promiseB`:

```js
const promiseA = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve(23);
});

const promiseB = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (12 * 12 === 144) {
    resolve(144);
  } else {
    reject({
      errorType: 'TypeError',
      message: `Unexpected type - expected ${typeof (12 * 12)}.`,
    });
  }
});

Promise.all([promiseA, promiseB])
  .then((values) => {
    console.log(`Results from Promise.all(): [${values}]`);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(`Promise.all Failed! \n${err.errorType}: ${err.message}`);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log('Operations for Promise.all() have finished.');
  });
```

The output would be:

```plaintext
Results from Promise.all(): [144,42]
Operations for Promise.all() have finished.
```
