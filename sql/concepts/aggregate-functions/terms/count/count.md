The `COUNT()` aggregate function returns the total number of rows that match the specified criteria.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name;
```

`COUNT()` is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of rows where the column is not `NULL`.

**Note:** A column name of the table can also be used instead of `*`. Unlike `COUNT(*)`, this variation `COUNT(column_name)` will not count `NULL` values in that column.

## Example

Suppose there's an `employees` table with the following values:

| name    | salary | experience |
| ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Michael | 80000  | 14         |
| Pam     | 41500  | 2          |
| Jim     | 45000  | 4          |
| Dwight  | 55000  | 8          |

To find the total number of employees who have less than 5 years of experience, the given query can be used:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE experience < 5;
```

The result would be:

| COUNT(\*) |
| --------- |
| 2         |
